# Music Player App
The music player app transcends the conventional boundaries of audio playback applications. It encapsulates the essence of user empowerment, offering a myriad of features that cater to diverse preferences and scenarios. From the meticulous attention to visual aesthetics to the seamless integration with contemporary technologies, the app provides not just a musical player but a transformative experience for users seeking harmony between functionality, style, and innovation. As it continues to evolve, the music player app remains a harmonious symphony of technology and user-centric design, redefining the contours of what a music player can achieve in the digital age.

# Description
I built an Android music player application in JAVA through Android Studio aiming at simplicity and performance, equipped with music sharing, customizable color themes, and comprehensive playback functionalities for locally stored tracks.

# Features
- **Playback Controls:** The app features an integrated equalizer at the bottom for users to customize their audio experience. Playback controls include options to loop songs, play the previous or next track, and pause/resume playback.
- **Song Information Display:** A dynamic tab at the bottom displays the current song’s name, an equalizer, and a timeline with song duration. Clicking on this tab expands it to reveal more details.
- **Artist, Album, and Song Navigation:** Users can click on an artist to reveal their albums. Further clicks on albums display the songs within. The timeline and song information tab adjust dynamically.
- **Dark & Light Themes:** Users can switch between dark and light themes, enhancing the app’s visual appeal. This setting is easily reversible, allowing users to choose their preferred theme.
- **Color Themes:** A selection of 17 color themes is available. Colors like red, pink, purple, deep purple, indigo, blue, light blue, cyan, teal, green, amber, orange, deep orange, brown, gray, blue-gray. Clicking on a theme instantly updates the app’s appearance. This feature adds a personalized touch to the user experience.
- **Sharing Audio:** Users can easily share music tracks from the app to various platforms or with friends. Increased user engagement and satisfaction due to the added convenience of sharing favorite music seamlessly. Enhanced app functionality, making it more competitive in the market by offering a sought-after feature.
- **Notification:** Users can control music playback without leaving their current app or unlocking the device, providing quick and easy access. The Notification Drawer Controls feature represents a key enhancement in the Music Player App, embodying the principles of user-centric design and convenience. By providing users with the ability to control music playback directly from the notification drawer, the app ensures a more immersive and enjoyable experience, solidifying its position as a user-friendly and feature-rich music player.
